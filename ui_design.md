### **UI Enhancement Prompt for Healthy Meal App**

**Objective:**
Enhance the UI/UX of the *Healthy Meal App* to improve visual appeal, accessibility, and interactivity while maintaining consistency with the dark theme and modern design principles.

---

### **Design Guidelines to Implement:**

1. **Typography:**

   * Use **Poppins** font consistently across all screens, ensuring proper weights and font sizes are used for headings, subheadings, and body text. Prioritize legibility and clarity.
   * Ensure **line-height** and **letter-spacing** are optimized for readability, especially on mobile screens.

2. **Color Scheme & Background:**

   * Stick to the **deep green-black background** (#121714) and **mint green accent color** (#94e0b2) for all interactive elements like buttons and highlights.
   * Use **white text** (#FFFFFF) for headings and dark grey for body text (#A2B4A9), ensuring strong contrast for readability.
   * Optimize the **background gradients** for sections like headers or cards, keeping the dark theme consistent with slight variations for differentiation.

3. **Button Styles:**

   * Enhance **buttons** by adding soft hover effects (e.g., color change or shadow effects) to improve interactivity.
   * Use consistent **rounded corners** for all buttons and form inputs.
   * For the **"Add to Cart"** and **"Favorite"** buttons, ensure that both have appropriate padding, icons (if necessary), and distinct color coding:

     * **Primary action** (Add to Cart): Mint Green background (#94e0b2) with white text.
     * **Secondary action** (Favorite): Subtle dark background (#2B362F) with white text.

4. **Icons & Interactivity:**

   * Ensure all **SVG icons** are clearly visible, using white for icons and optimizing their placement for better alignment (e.g., around buttons or navigation bars).
   * For interactive elements like **checkboxes** or **toggles**, use contrasting colors (mint green for active states) and ensure the elements are sufficiently large for mobile interaction.
   * Maintain consistency in icon size across all screens to improve overall visual harmony.

5. **Card Layouts & Meal Information:**

   * Use **meal card designs** that highlight the food image clearly (use of **rounded corners** for image containers) and display meal names, descriptions, and calorie information in an aesthetically pleasing way.
   * Ensure **meal description** sections are easy to read, with a balance of text size and spacing to avoid clutter.

6. **Navigation Bar:**

   * The **bottom navigation bar** should have clear icons with descriptive labels (e.g., **Home**, **Search**, **Saved**, **Orders**, **Profile**).
   * Enhance the selected state of icons by using a mint green indicator under the active icon or changing the icon color to mint green.

7. **Search Bar:**

   * The **search bar** should have a prominent placement at the top of the **Search** screen with a well-defined, rounded box design.
   * Integrate a **location toggle** and a **search history section** where users can filter their search history or clear it.
   * Improve **placeholder text** styling for better user guidance (e.g., grey color for placeholder text).

8. **Form Inputs:**

   * Form inputs (e.g., for **name**, **email**, and **password**) should have consistent **rounded corners** and **subtle borders** to match the appâ€™s overall aesthetic.
   * Focus states should be highlighted with a **slightly brighter background color** or a **glow effect** for better user feedback when interacting with text fields.

9. **Profile Page:**

   * Profile images should be displayed in a **circular container** with soft borders. Allow users to click on the profile image for updates.
   * Keep the profile details section clean with text like **"Email"**, **"Phone"**, **"Password"**, **"Subscription Status"** laid out clearly.
   * Add the option for users to update their **profile info** directly through clickable edit icons.

10. **Health Summary Section:**

    * Display the **health metrics** in a **card format** with clean, separated sections (BMI, weight, height, calories).
    * Use **progress bars** or **pie charts** for a more visual representation of **calorie tracking** or **health goal progress**.

11. **Premium & Membership Sections:**

    * Make **premium content** distinct by adding a **badge or label** saying "Premium" for users who have subscribed.
    * In the **Membership page**, add a **"Renew Now"** button with visually prominent call-to-action (CTA) styling.
    * For **subscription management**, use **toggle switches** for users to enable or disable auto-renewal with appropriate feedback when toggled.

12. **General Interactivity:**

    * Implement **smooth animations** when switching between sections or screens, such as **sliding** or **fading effects** to make transitions less jarring and more pleasant for the user.
    * Add **loading states** for images, data retrieval, or when the user adds items to the cart, which can be shown through **shimmer effects** or **spinners**.

### **UI/UX Enhancements:**

* **Responsive Design:** Ensure the app's UI is **fully responsive**, optimizing layouts for both **small screen** and **large screen** devices.
* **Accessibility:** Implement text scaling options, and make sure the contrast ratio for all text elements meets **WCAG standards** for better accessibility.

### **Design Testing:**

* **Usability Testing:** Conduct user testing to evaluate the ease of navigation, clarity of instructions, and overall design experience.
* **A/B Testing:** Test variations of the **CTA buttons**, **icon placements**, and **card layouts** to determine the most effective designs.
