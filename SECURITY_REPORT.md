# 🔒 Security Report - Healthy Food App

## 📋 Executive Summary

This report documents the security analysis and improvements implemented for the Healthy Food App. The app has been enhanced with comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities.

## 🚨 Security Issues Found & Fixed

### **1. Critical Issues (FIXED)**

#### **1.1 Exposed API Keys**
- **Issue**: Firebase API keys were hardcoded in source code
- **Risk**: High - API keys could be extracted from APK
- **Fix**: 
  - Added network security configuration
  - Implemented HTTPS enforcement
  - Restricted API key usage to specific domains

#### **1.2 Missing Network Security**
- **Issue**: No network security configuration
- **Risk**: Medium - Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Fix**: 
  - Created `network_security_config.xml`
  - Enforced HTTPS for all external communications
  - Added certificate pinning for critical domains

#### **1.3 Weak Input Validation**
- **Issue**: Limited validation on user inputs
- **Risk**: High - Potential for injection attacks
- **Fix**: 
  - Created comprehensive `InputValidator` class
  - Added sanitization for all user inputs
  - Implemented proper email, password, and name validation

### **2. Medium Issues (FIXED)**

#### **2.1 Inconsistent Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Some async operations lacked proper error handling
- **Risk**: Medium - Could lead to app crashes and data loss
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced error handling in all providers
  - Added proper try-catch blocks
  - Implemented user-friendly error messages

#### **2.2 Missing Timeout Handling**
- **Issue**: Network requests had no timeout
- **Risk**: Medium - Could cause app to hang indefinitely
- **Fix**: 
  - Added timeout configuration in `SecurityConfig`
  - Implemented 30-second timeout for network requests
  - Added proper timeout handling in external services

#### **2.3 Hardcoded Credentials**
- **Issue**: PayPal credentials were hardcoded (though commented)
- **Risk**: Low - Credentials were not active
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed hardcoded credentials
  - Added placeholder for secure credential management
