# Map Issues Fix Guide

## Problem Summary
The app was experiencing map-related crashes due to:
1. **Google Maps dependency conflict** - `google_maps_flutter` was still in pubspec.yaml
2. **Mixed map implementations** - Both Google Maps and flutter_map were being used
3. **API key errors** - Google Maps was trying to initialize without proper API keys

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Google Maps Dependency
- Removed `google_maps_flutter: ^2.5.3` from `pubspec.yaml`
- Cleaned up all Google Maps imports from the codebase

### 2. Standardized on flutter_map
- Using `flutter_map: ^8.1.1` with OpenStreetMap tiles
- No API key required - completely free and open source
- Better performance and reliability

### 3. Created Reusable Map Widget
- Added `LocationMapWidget` in `lib/widgets/shimmer_loader.dart`
- Handles invalid coordinates gracefully (defaults to Kuala Lumpur)
- Consistent styling across the app
- Easy to use: `LocationMapWidget(latitude: lat, longitude: lng)`

### 4. Updated Map Implementation
- **Order History Screen**: Now uses the reusable `LocationMapWidget`
- **Meal List Screen**: Cleaned up unused imports
- **Cart Screen**: Cleaned up unused imports

## Key Features of the New Map Implementation

### LocationMapWidget Features:
- **Fallback coordinates**: Defaults to Kuala Lumpur (3.1390, 101.6869) if coordinates are 0.0
- **Customizable height**: Default 150px, can be adjusted
- **Optional title**: Can show a title above the map
- **Rounded corners**: Consistent with app design
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of tile loading errors
- **No API keys needed**: Uses OpenStreetMap tiles

### Usage Example:
```dart
LocationMapWidget(
  latitude: meal.latitude,
  longitude: meal.longitude,
  height: 150,
  title: 'Restaurant Location',
)
```

## Final Steps to Complete the Fix

### Step 1: Clean Project
```bash
flutter clean
```

### Step 2: Delete Lock File
```bash
rm pubspec.lock
```

### Step 3: Get Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **No API Keys Required**: OpenStreetMap is completely free
2. **Better Performance**: flutter_map is lighter than Google Maps
3. **Consistent Design**: Reusable widget ensures uniform appearance
4. **Error Resilient**: Handles invalid coordinates gracefully
5. **Future-Proof**: No dependency on Google services

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check for remaining Google Maps references**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "google_maps" lib/
   ```

2. **Verify flutter_map installation**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub deps | grep flutter_map
   ```

3. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub cache repair
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Map Features Available

- **Interactive maps** in order history
- **Location markers** for restaurant locations
- **Zoom and pan** functionality
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes
- **Offline capability** (with proper tile caching)

The app now has a robust, reliable map implementation that doesn't require any API keys or external services!
